      <h4>eCybermission: Cost-Efficient Water Filter</h4>
      <p>In many places there is a lack of drinkable and accessible water. This encouraged my team and I to look for small, convenient solutions for water filters. We devised a plan to construct a cost-efficient solar still which uses light energy to perform its functions. In this device, the evaporated water condenses into clean water. Our project saw success & has scope to build more cost-efficient devices. We believe this is a major step in providing clean water to people with less access. Our project won 1st place in the state for the eCybermission contest.

      <h4>Nucleotide Hackathon</h4>
      <p>ForDa Hub is an easily accessible data-sharing network that can let anyone contribute to huge datasets without having to start from scratch. The website will be free for everyone. By letting anyone around the world contribute, users will be able to receive a wider range of data that can help with machine learning and data science applications. A common machine learning issue is not having a wide enough range of data, and ForDa Hub solves that issue. By making data contributions available to everyone, people can contribute to a greater variety of data.</p>
